# Drowsiness-Detection

## Intro
The Project uses YOLOv5 for detection if person is awake or drowsy.

## How to use
For the first time uses the project requires user to get YOLOv5 model which is available for free on GitHub as well as couple of more librarires.
To get those, command have been written and commented, thus only need to comment them out and run them.
The project also contain the custom model training and thus, requires it to be train before using

## Future Notes
The model isn't to complex to begin with and by labelling and training with different data, can be used for making multiple object detection models.
Models can also be used on pre recorded videos, photos as well as real time data.
